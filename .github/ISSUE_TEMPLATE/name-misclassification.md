Note that some misclassification is unfortunately inevitable. This is both because the approach taken by this library if fairly simplistic and because a person's name is not necessarily reflective of their gender.

**Describe what is misclassfied**
Include the name(s) and the specific code used during classification.

**Check namelists**
Does the name exists in any of the [name lists](https://github.com/michaelmior/genderComputer/tree/master/nameLists)? If so, indicate which list if you believe the name to be classified. If not, please indicate which list you believe the name should be added to.
